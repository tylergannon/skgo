Feature: Server loads written in Go

  Every `+page.server.ts` and `+layout.server.ts` under `/account` is generated
  from a `page.server.go` or `layout.server.go` beside it, and every generated
  body throws. SvelteKit's own client asks Go for `/<route>/__data.json` on
  every navigation, so anything that renders below proves Go answered it.

  The section is protected by one rule, written once in its layout, and the
  session that rule reads is derived once by the app's `handle` hook.

  The same claims run against the bundle the adapter built and the modules
  `vp dev` transforms. Go renders the document and owns every load in both.

  Scenario: Moving between two pages under one layout does not re-run the layout's load
    Given I have signed in as "ada"
    When I visit "/account"
    And I note the layout serial
    And I follow the "Orders" link
    Then I see "Orders"
    And the layout serial is unchanged
    When I follow the "Overview" link
    Then I see "Overview"
    And the layout serial is unchanged
    When I refresh the account layout
    Then the layout serial has changed
    And the account layout greets "ada"
